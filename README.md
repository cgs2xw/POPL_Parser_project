To run the project:

Ensure you have the proper libraries installed (Antlr4, antlr4-python3-runtime)
This library is an open-source library made by Yuval Shavit for ready-made counter for indent/dedent.

1. Generate Python files from g4:
1.   a) inside "Project" directory, run antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 Python.g4
2. Run the parser:
2.   a) same directory, run python Parse.py

After running, this will bring up the parsing tree gui as well as print a flat text format
